# Zellij Framework

![Logo](logo.webp)


Welcome to Zellij, an asynchronous Python web framework designed with the heart and innovation of Morocco. Inspired by the rich tradition and artistic heritage of Morocco, Zellij aims to blend the robustness of Django with the simplicity and performance of FastAPI, adopting an MVC architecture. Our goal is to empower developers with a tool that simplifies web development without compromising on efficiency or flexibility. Proudly made in Morocco, Zellij is for developers who appreciate artistry in code.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Core**: Leveraging Starlette for non-blocking request handling.
- **ORM Support**: Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy, providing async support and compatibility with a wide range of databases.
- **MVC Architecture**: Emphasizing clear separation of concerns through Models, Views, and Controllers.
- **CLI Tools**: Simplify common tasks like server startup and database migrations with intuitive CLI commands.
- **Security Focused**: Secure authentication, session management, and advanced password hashing.
- **Templating with Jinja2**: For dynamic content rendering.
- **Testing Support**: Encourages test-driven development with pytest.
